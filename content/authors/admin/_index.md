My research focuses on the application of latent variable models to the measurement of psychopathology and health risk behaviors in adolescence and early adulthood. As a quantitative psychologist, I generally do statistical analyses on pre-existing datasets in order to help untangle the complex set of factors which drive people toward and away from healthy behaviors across development.
