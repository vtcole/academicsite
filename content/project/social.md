How does an adolescent's position among their peers affect their risk of substance use? Our collaborative team including graduate and undergraduate students is conducting a systematic review to synthesize the current evidence about this question. The empirical portion of this project, conducted in collaboration with researchers at UNC Chapel Hill, uses the Context dataset to assess the longitudinal associations between social network position and smoking in a school-based sample of middle and high school students.
